0. [A Survey on Bias and Fairness in Machine Learning (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.09635)  Ninareh Mehrabi (University of Southern California), Fred Morstatter (University of Southern California), Nripsuta Saxena (University of Southern California) Kristina Lerman (University of Southern California), Aram Galstyan (University of Southern California).
Key ideas: Systematically summary and categorize definitions of fairness, methods for fairness-aware machine learning, state challenges and future opportunities  
Sources Bias-> bias arising from data, bias arising from algorithms  
Types of fairness-> individual fairness, group fairness, subgroup fairness  
Methods that target biases in algorithms-> pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing  
Challenges-> how to transform from equality to equity (each individual or group is given the resources they need to succeed), is one synthetic definition of fairness possible, given a dataset how to identify unfairness
